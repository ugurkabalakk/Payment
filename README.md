# Payment
Payment API by Ugur
## Getting Started

There are two endpoints. One of them  is to create a payment and the other is to get created payment. Each payment instance is associated  with an order instance. Attributes of these entities are listed below

```powershell
  Implement Create Payment Flow: Write an endpoint that allows users to create a payment and 
persist in a datastore.
  Implement Get Payment Flow: Write an endpoint that returns the payment together with associated 
order
```
